There are many great Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers for Phoenix. [Render](https://render.com/docs/deploy-phoenix), and [Fly.io](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/elixir/) especially, and they have great documentation for getting up and running.
PaaS providers have lots of benefits, including ease of deployments, managed databases with automatic backups, and more.
But using a plain Virtual Private Server (VPS) can get you more power for a lot less money.
This is especailly true if you are running multiple apps.

<Alert title="Don't use this for critical applications">
  This is a guide for deploying a side projects and non-critical apps. If you
  are running a production application, you should use a PaaS provider.
</Alert>

In this post, we are going to go from (almost) zero to deployment using Hetzner, but you can follow along using other cloud providers, such as [Linode](https://linode.com), [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), or even AWS or GCP.
I chose [Hetzner](https://hetzner.com) for their great reviews, and low price.

I am assuming familiarity with the command line and git.
If you get stuck at point, just shoot me an [email](mailto:me@josephlozano.dev).

## Get a server

Create an account at https://cloud.hetzner.com, and create a server in a region near you.
I chose Ashburn, VA, Ubuntu 22.04, Standard, and the cheapest option CPX11.
I already had an ssh set up (for github, so I uploaded the public key to Hetzner and used that).

After you click "Create and Buy Now", your server will take a few seconds to provision.
Once it is done provisioning, take note of the IP address.
We will use it later.

## Setup DNS

This could really be done at the end, but since DNS propagation could take some time, better to just get it out of the way early.
I use namecheap, so I am going to set up a A record, pointing `phoenix.joseph.wtf` to the IP address of my server from Hetzner.

## Phoenix Application Set Up

If Elixir and Phoenix are not already installed on your machine, install them now. [Instructions](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html).

```bash
# Your machine
yes | mix phx.new my_app --verbose
cd my_app
git init
git add -A
git commit -am "init"
```

Create a repo in your git repository of choice, such as Github, or Gitlab.

Now here is the real magic.

```bash
# Your machine
mix phx.gen.release --docker # ðŸ¤¯
```

This created a few files, the most important of which is the `Dockerfile` .

Lets also create a file called `docker-compose.yaml`

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    env_file: ".env"
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"
    depends_on:
      - "postgres"
    restart: "always"
  postgres:
    image: "postgres:15.2-bullseye"
    env_file: ".env"
    volumes:
      - "postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data"
    restart: "always"
  migration:
    build: .
    env_file: ".env"
    depends_on:
      - web
      - postgres
    command: bin/migrate
    restart: "no"
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2.6.4-alpine
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: caddy reverse-proxy --from https://phoenix.joseph.wtf:443 --to http://web:4000
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - caddy:/data
    depends_on:
      - web
volumes:
  postgres: {}
  caddy: {}
```

<Alert color="info">
  Replace `phoenix.joseph.wtf` in the `caddy`/`command` section with your domain name.
</Alert>

Next, create a `.env` file, which will hold your applicaton secrets.

<Alert title=".env contains application secrets!">
  Make sure you add this file to `.gitignore`.
</Alert>
You can generate a secret key base with `mix phx.gen.secret`. Since this file is
ignored by git, you'll want to add it (with different secrets) to both your development
machine, and the prod machine.

```bash
# .env
SECRET_KEY_BASE=<run mix phx.gen.secret>
PHX_HOST="phoenix.joseph.wtf"
POSTGRES_USER=my_app
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
POSTGRES_DB=my_app
DATABASE_URL=postgres://${POSTGRES_USER}:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@postgres:5432/${POSTGRES_DB}
```

Now that we've created our release, and `docker-compose.yaml` file, we can commit.

```bash
# Your machine
# make sure .env is ignored by git.
git add -A
git commit -m "Dockerize"
git push
```

Now, bring it all together on your development machine.
Run `docker-compose up --build`.
Because we are forwarding port 4000 from Docker, we just visit https://localhost:4000 to see our app running in Docker.

## Ready, Set, Deploy

### Setting up our prod machine

```bash
# Your machine
# Replace id_ed25519 with your SSH private key,
# and 5.161.109.211 with the IP address of the server you provisioned
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 root@<your_ip>
```

After this command, you will be in a terminal prompt on your production machine.

First install docker per the most up to date instructions on [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository)

```bash
# Prod machine
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release

sudo mkdir -m 0755 -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

```bash
# Prod machine
# replace with the URL of your repo
git clone https://github.com/joseph-lozano/my_app
cd my_app
# create a .env file with your application secrets, just like on the development machine
vi .env
```

After all that is done, just run

```bash
# Prod machine
docker-compose up --build -d
```
